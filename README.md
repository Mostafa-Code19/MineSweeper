# MineSweeper

version1:
This version will recognize the position by checking by an if statement like if it in corner or border or around the middle.

version2:
this will read all around the element if there is no element so skip it and this will read all the element without any useless function to recognition of the position.

latest version:
will find number 1 and all the other element which have number 1 and then will go for 2 and 3 and go on. after this function will see the board if there is S element, if there will check around it and also for other. third step is checking for ? element if there is will check it. if there is no answer for it will start from the beginning and if it is still, end will unknown elements.
